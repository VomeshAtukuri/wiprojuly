Task: Normalization of CourseDetails Table

Given Table: CourseDetails
Attributes:

Copy
Edit
(Ccode, Coursename, Duration, Fee, 
 StudentNo, StudentName, City, Gender, 
 FacultyCode, FacultyName, Qualification, 
 PaymentId, PaymentDate, 
 BatchCode, BatchName, StartDate, EndDate, Timing)

------------------------
First Normal Form (1NF)

Observations:
All values are atomic (no multi-valued or repeating groups).

Therefore, the table satisfies 1NF.
No structural change needed in 1NF

--------------------------------
Second Normal Form (2NF)

Observations:
Assume composite key: (StudentNo, Ccode) or (StudentNo, BatchCode)

Found partial dependencies:
Ccode → Coursename, Duration, Fee
StudentNo → StudentName, City, Gender
FacultyCode → FacultyName, Qualification
BatchCode → BatchName, StartDate, EndDate, Timing, Ccode, FacultyCode
PaymentId → PaymentDate, StudentNo


To remove partial dependencies, break the table into:
Student(StudentNo, StudentName, City, Gender)
Course(Ccode, Coursename, Duration, Fee)
Faculty(FacultyCode, FacultyName, Qualification)
Batch(BatchCode, BatchName, StartDate, EndDate, Timing, Ccode, FacultyCode)
Payment(PaymentId, PaymentDate, StudentNo)
Enrollment(StudentNo, BatchCode) – (To track student’s course batch)

Now the schema is in 2NF

---------------------------------
Third Normal Form (3NF)

Observations:

Identified transitive dependencies:

BatchCode → Ccode, and Ccode → Coursename implies BatchCode → Coursename (transitive)
PaymentId → StudentNo, and StudentNo → StudentName implies PaymentId → StudentName (transitive)

Action:
Ensure all non-key attributes depend only on the primary key, not through other non-key attributes.

Already achieved in 2NF design by proper separation of entities.
Now the schema is in 3NF

Final 3NF Tables:

Student
(StudentNo, StudentName, City, Gender)

Course
(Ccode, Coursename, Duration, Fee)

Faculty
(FacultyCode, FacultyName, Qualification)

Batch
(BatchCode, BatchName, StartDate, EndDate, Timing, Ccode, FacultyCode)

Payment
(PaymentId, PaymentDate, StudentNo)

Enrollment
(StudentNo, BatchCode)
